## Planning Bench

*Discussing about project legacy*

Concern: **The project being abandoned**

Suggestions: 
* Create milestones
* Document decisions
* Maintain it open source

*About agile rituals, more specifically **ustwo***

Concern: **Keeping up with the project tasks while we're also working with paying projects**

* Bernardo mentioned having sprints and we can work with some random time thought it
	* Example, serrate tasks for a month, dev can pick up any out of them, with the goal of reaching a certain story point total value
	* Keep short meetings to checkin progress
* Tasks to be done in personal time
	* We can also formalize it to have some time in the week to take care of the project in working hours
	* Other option to oficialize it as a sponsored open source project worked in-house
		* It would be nice to have it presentable for people to give their opinions and decide if we should move forward with it
* As it's a side project, everything is really prone to change but also there's not a lot in stake, we can change everything as demands change and learning is acquired

*About navigation design*

* After meeting with Ana, Bernardo decided to remove sub-menus as it's not a problem that we currently have
* Bernardo worked in the accessibility, Lighthouse is giving a good score, and VoiceOver seems to be working good
* Using Radix as a UI Library 

## Outcomes

**Defining the main project goal**: Make the project be presentable, making it simple to understand, so that we can receive feedback and better decide on the future of the project. We should also share it on a eurotechno. 

Note that the project can always be worked in off-work even if theres no positive feedbacks :)
